 * Hello my name is Techinstein on the web. I am a huge Tech Microsoft / Android enthusiast. This
 is going to be my first Android project and attempt of making the WWW's most unique rom  that's       
 going to be kanged from Purity Rom and for the Nexus 7. Feel free to compile for any Android Device
 just give me and the Purity Rom team credits.  This rom will soon have a main website I code with
 HTML5, CSS3, DreamWeaver , Adobe Muse. I recently obtained a Adobe CC license and am using Adobe
 products to create the best website possible. Website will have 247 live chat across every page.           
 A blog with posts for all things tech.           
                                                                                                            
 * The goal of Purity Kang is to stay Purity Rom smooth and add as many customizable features possible.
 I plan on cherry picking features from ; CyanogenMod , AICP , PAC-Man rom, Omni Rom , and Slim.            
 
 *
